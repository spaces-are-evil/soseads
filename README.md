[So]rt/[Se]arch [A]lgorithms and [D]ata [S]tructures: A comprehensive library of search algorithms, sorting algorithms and data structures. This library is written in raw JavaScript with no dependencies.

PROJECT STATUS: This project is under development. 

CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED:
The following data structures are currently implemented:
-Stack
-Queue
-Circular Buffer
-Binary Search Tree

The following sorting/searching algorithms are currently implemented:
-Insertion Sort
-Selection Sort
-Merge Sort
-Pre-Order Search Traversal (BST)

Full test scenarios will be developed for each data structure.

FUTURE PLANS:
I have big plans for this library, and will have a vast coverage of data structures and algorithms.
